/* Your challenge is to change the color of all anchor elements that fulfil the following criteria:

The anchor is part of an unordered list
The anchor has a class called listRight
The anchor is a child of an element which has a class called container
The anchor element should change to the color red when a user hovers over it. Use the nesting and the & selector to achieve this effect.

Use the hint tab to access the boilerplate files. The elements you want to target are included in the index.html file. */

.container {
    .listRight {
        a {
          &:hover {
            color: red;    
          } 
        }
    }
